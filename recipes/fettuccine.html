  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo is an Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>24 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>1 cup butter</li>
      <li>3/4 pint heavy cream</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. </li>
      <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce. </li>
      <li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
