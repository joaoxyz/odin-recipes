    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stroganoff is an originally Russian dish of saut√©ed pieces of beef served in a sauce of mustard and sour cream. From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from the original recipe. Mushrooms are common in many variants.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
